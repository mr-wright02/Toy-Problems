# Toy-Problems
These are code challenges focusing on solving a niche in:
1. Grading System.
2. Salary Calaculation system.
3. Speed Detector system.

# Grading System
In this the code isable to accept users input, it validates the input and gives out the required output.
if the grade is not in the scope captured, the system directs you to input valid grades ranging from 0-100.
it is able to do all these using the if and else conditional statements.

# Salary Calculation system
In this system we are able to calculate the salary for individuals by providing their monthly gross income and benefits.
I was able to use fixed variable on tax rates but with desire to make it a variable that can capture salary rates of different job groups.

# Speed Detector System
It is a simple code that allows user input from the standard input devices (keyboard)
from the input, the speed is validated and if 7is at <=70; its ok
if the speed is greater than 70 you are given demerit points and when the demerit pints are more than 10, your DL is suspended.
